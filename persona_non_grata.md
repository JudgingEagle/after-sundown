# Persona non Grata
_Some things you're better off not knowing about. Some objects, too._

The realm of horror is a pretty big place, and it's full of crazy crap. And lots of that stuff is unique. So while the rules make a good starting point for the creation of characters, they are only that: a _starting_ point. Each individual person and twisted tale of tormented tools is going to be - at least ideally - crafted _individually_. This chapter contains some samples that have been made ready to use in the game, as well as some pointers on how to go about making your own.

It is important to note that the various nouns selected here are merely _examples_, and while it is fine to grab them for use in your own campaign, it is well within the prerogative of the MC to modify them or write them out entirely. People in the world of After Sundown believe in these people, places, and things in roughly the same way that people believe in Madison Wisconsin or the President of the United States: they probably have never been there or met them _personally_, but their existence doesn't seem implausible and other people talk about them as if they were real. However, on the far side of the Vow of Silence it is notably difficult to go check C-Span or the equivalent. The normal clues that someone is _enlarging_ upon a tale or a description of a person simply don't apply when discussing a supernatural creature - when they got angry maybe they _literally_ caught fire. So it's pretty easy for a story to get exaggerated after multiple repetitions. The Wolf Mother of Ergenekon _probably_ wasn't really 6 meters long (although she may have been). 

## People
_No you should've stayed out of my way. Do not test me, 'cause I'm the fucking king of the world!_

Making NPCs is likely the part of storytelling that the MC will be called upon to do the most. Many times, players will take the action to some place unexpected. Maybe they will have a throwdown in a bowling alley, or decide to follow up on some minor rumors about the docks. It is a good idea to have a cast of characters who can be used with modest adjustments in lieu of other characters who suddenly become important. Some of this can - and should - be done in the form of having a script of random bullshit for non-player characters to make small talk with. The use and re-use of common small talk phrases by random people in various parts of the chronicle can quickly become a running gag, which frees the PCs to explore in a more sandbox fashion.

What follows are some sample characters. It is entirely intentional that these characters are entirely recognizable rips from popular culture. Ultimately when creating NPC cast members of your own, you will want to transform ideas in your mind into the numbers and abilities that represent a character in After Sundown. Therefore it is more useful as an example for the sample characters to be ones which you could plausibly be familiar with the _idea_ in addition to the stats themselves.

### Dean
Dean spent several years as a slave soldier to the King with Three Shadows after he sold his soul to get a family member raised from the dead. Since escaping from Limbo, he spends most of his time traveling the country and killing monsters, which has earned him a place as a respected hunter in the Stellar Oracles, but a noted name on the shit list of several Makhzen Princes.
Dean is a Fallen. He is rather brash and tends to leap into danger as soon as he sees the barest opportunity to do so. In combat he will activate Quickness immediately, and when investigating things he will generally mimic a governmental authority figure. Dean's Powers grant him a +2 bonus to Socialization and a similar bonus to people asking about him later, and he almost never shies from this, grabbing the center of attention with Atract any time he enters a bar. He gains a +2 bonus to soak damage against weapons that are not iron, and personally has a true name that he does not use (Taxiarch Μιχαήλ) and knows the true name of everyone he runs into. Dean deals with a Master Passion of Rage, though admittedly, not very well.

### Jack
Jack is a trucker who has been married many times and lived many different lives in many different cities. And that's even before you factor in the fact that he has begun to remember past incarnations of himself, where he apparently used to be a warrior in ancient China. He is openly skeptical that these "memories" are anything other than particularly vivid and weird dreams, but nonetheless finds himself embroiled in some seriously weird shit. Driven by a constant feeling that things are not right, Jack seeks out and gets new relationships frequently. And while he frequently just drifts off from his previous lives and interests (and has a legacy of failed marriage to show for it), he doesn't specifically do anything _bad_, and maintains a friendship with all of his ex-wives.

Jack is a Reborn. Jack has a Master Passion of Despair. Jack's Powers grant him a +2 bonus to Socialization and a similar bonus to people asking about him later, an ability he calls upon only if the subtle approach fails. Jack often tries to get through confrontation without drawing upon magical powers at all, but if he feels in danger he will reset things and go into full speed mode. After all, as Jack always says "It's all in the reflexes."

### Marionette
Marionette is a harlequin clown from Southern France who made her own elaborate performance enhancing drugs that eventually drove her quite mad. She isn't exactly certain that she isn't a human anymore, but she rarely takes the makeup off and continues to inject herself with "performance enhancements" of various sorts. She is a hanger-on to supernatural politics, preferring to promote the world as some kind of massive clown stage where people apparently get fed to hyenas.

Marionette is an Icarid. A natural contrarion, Marionette gains a +4 bonus to argue against any course of action, and a +4 bonus to soak damage against weapons that are not iron.

### Dante
Dante is not supernatural, and doesn't actually believe that the supernatural exists at all. He is the manager of a Quick Stop, and would be almost wholly uninvolved in the machinations of monsters save for the fact that he _is_ a Luminary.

### Chris
Chris is a _bystander_. He works at the SK8R|, and he pours beers. Chris is an Extra, and is of primary note in that his stat line can be used with minor adjustments for all kinds of extras who work in different parts of the realms of horror.

### The Black Isz
There are a cadre of Mirror Goblins who work for a vicious killer: a dangerous Baali named Artemis Pender. The player characters may never meet Artemis Pender or learn what it is that he is doing - but his Mirror Goblin agents are sufficiently numerous that they may be encountered many times. A typical group will be between 4 and 6 of the Isz, and be dispatched with some identifiable (if baroque) mission. Abilities vary slightly within an Isz pack, but one of them might look like this:

## Animals
_"Lions, tigers, **and** bears?"_

People are a form of animal. Vampires are humans. Humans are apes. Apes are monkeys. Monkeys are mammals. And mammals are animals. However, not all animals are people, and indeed most of them are not. Animals get a separate entry precisely because their capabilities, while generally much more limited than a human's, are incredibly varied. It's just not particularly helpful to attempt to use the same system to generate a hippo and a hamster.

Animals have wildly different speeds than that of a human. And so what is given is simply the creature's speed during a draining sprint. For simplicity, animals move proportionally less fast than that when doing other kinds of movement. Remember also that real life 70 kilogram humans often only have 1 or 2 in an attribute, so don't be terribly surprised if many animals have values that are very low. Inherent in the dicepool system is an assumption of basically human norms, and creatures significantly outside those norms have numbers that are significantly outside those values. The game simply does not have the granularity to differentiate the strength of animals that are not as strong as a person - and that's most of them (people are pretty strong).

### Rat
Game mechanically not particularly different from a hamster or a mouse. Or pretty much any rodent. Or a small lagomorph like a bunny. These creatures are not individually threatening unless they happen to carry disease, and even then can be "defeated" by an old woman with a broom. Small animals like this suffer wounds as if any attack had inflicted 3 more wound levels. Even a small firearm is generally overkill. They are very small though, so the threshold to hit them from any range past Near is increased by 1. Rats are a  frequently used magical spy because they are so ubiquitous.

**Skills:** Athletics 2; Combat 1; Perception 2; Stealth 4; Survival 3

**Speed:** 45m

### Bat
Bats are cute little nocturnal insectivores. Or sometimes hematophages. Tiny animals like this suffer wounds as if any attack had inflicted 3 more wound levels. They are very small though, so the threshold to hit them from any range past Near is increased by 1.

S: 0; A: 3; I: 3; L: 1; W: 1; C: 2

**Skills:** Athletics 4; Combat 1; Perception 4; Stealth 2; Survival 2

**Speed:** 200m (Flying)

### Raven
Ravens are creatures of ill omen, mainly because they eat carrion, but also because a raven is always thinking about how to peck your eyes out. Ravens are small, and suffer wounds as if any attack had inflicted 2 more wound levels than its base value. Attacks against them from farther than Short range have their thresholds increased by 1. Ravens are popular as familiars for witches and the like, because they can be taught to speak simple human words. Also they can fly.

**Skills:** Athletics 3; Combat 3; Perception 2; Stealth 1; Survival 2

**Speed:** 250m (Flying)

### Cat
House cats are important to many magical beings as a symbol of status. Cats are small, and suffer wounds as if any attack had inflicted 2 more wound levels than its base value. Attacks against them from farther than Short range have their thresholds increased by 1.

S: 0; A: 3; I: 3; L: 1; W: 2; C: 1

**Skills:** Athletics 3; Combat 3; Perception 2; Stealth 2; Survival 2

**Speed:** 120m

### Cobra
Various deadly snakes are a mainstay of horror and adventure fiction. Why does it have to be snakes? Because they are creepy looking and don't make footfall noises when they move. Cobras and vipers and rattlesnakes are poisonous, and largely interchangeable from a storytelling standpoint. Poisonous snakes are small, and suffer wounds as if any attack had inflicted 2 more wound levels than its base value. Attacks against them from farther than Short range have their thresholds increased by 1.

S: 1; A: 3; I: 1; L: 1; W: 2; C: 1

**Skills:** Athletics 2; Combat 3; Perception 2; Stealth 4; Survival 2

**Advantages and Disadvantages:** Double Jointed

**Speed:** 40m

### Large Dog
It is important to note that a large and scary dog is still genuinely on the small side for an actual human being, and that while a dog's teeth are frightening, they are not actually as deadly as a baseball bat or a crowbar in the hands of an angry dude. A large dog's teeth and claws amount to a 1N weapon. While a dog can indeed perform a fatal mauling, this is generally not accomplished without many seconds of worrying (that's the thing dogs do where they grab something in their mouth and shake it).

S: 2; A: 3; I: 3; L: 1; W: 2; C: 1

**Skills:** Athletics 3; Combat 4; Perception 4; Stealth 2; Survival (tracking) 2

**Speed:** 150m

### Alligator
Aligators are the pit monster of choice, because while they aren't super fast and have profound difficulties getting out of a pit, they _are_ pretty deadly and terrifying. The jaws of an alligator are a 2 damage weapon, and alligators have a point of armor. A couple of hungry alligators in a pit can make short work of most victims, making them an ideal death trap for any insane cultists or world conquering madmen.

S: 5; A: 1; I: 1; L: 1; W: 3; C: 1

**Skills:** Athletics 2; Combat 4; Perception 2; Stealth 2; Survival 2

**Speed:** 50m

**Advantages and Disadvantages:** Combat Paralysis

## Places
_"I am the master of all I see, so long as all I see is that which I have mastered."_

Mystical locations are amongst the _least_ destabilizing of all possible special magics. The fact that they are large compared to a person and completely non-transportable means that they can be worked into one story without necessarily having a strong impact on any later stories.

### The Pet Cemetery
You all know the legend of the pet cemetery where if you bury someone "just right"they come back from the dead. And maybe (like, almost every time) it goes horribly wrong and the person or animal comes back as some sort of hideous monster that probably eats people or something. That sort of thing _exists_ in After Sundown. It's a kind of Shadow Gate, and the thing that makes it of interest is that they aren't continuously open, so they aren't spraying a horde of poltergeists all over everything, nor does it _necessarily_ come with a giant zombie apocalypse. The idea is that there are things you have to do in order to activate the Shadow Gate, and even then only for brief periods. So while it _can_ be used to transform the corpse of a Luminary into a Revenant, and by extension can be used to start a zombie outbreak deliberately, it doesn't have to be. And that's _great_ news for supernaturals who want to send people and things back and forth to Mictlan and _don't_ want a never ending ghost storm or zombie tide. These "locked gates" are, while certainly dangerous, highly prized.A Locked Shadow Gate requires some "key" to "open". While open, it can function as a two way passage to The Gloom, and it can manifest Necromancies like a normal Shadowgate would. The one from the King novel of the same name opened for one hour the midnight following someone making a stack of rocks in front of it. This was used to raise the dead, with different corpses coming back as per Reanimation, and others coming back as per Resurrection. The very unpredictability of it (and the fact that zombies created in this manner are completely uncontrolled) is why those in the know about supernatural events generally suggest _not_ trying to bring loved ones back with a Locked Gate. A Locked or Open Shadowgate both constitute a rating 3 Destiny.

### The Goblin Market
It's a wretched hive of scum and villainy to be sure, but an invaluable source of information and rare goods. Step through the mirror and you find yourself in a grungy and ash strewn marketplace where foul abominations sell horrid things to one another. For the right number of kittens, you could get yourself rare spices, dubious information, or a group of shady mercenaries from all over the world. There are a number of egresses from the Goblin Market, and while all of their Limbo sides are within the marketplace, their human world sides are all over the place.

The Goblin Market is a _Mirror Nexus_, a small area of the Dark Reflection that is connected to several mirrors in different parts of the mortal world. Most of those gate mirrors are actually quite immobile (such as the lake surface), or transient (such as the newly washed window of a skyscraper), but there are a few entrances that are portable enough for someone to own one. Like any Mirror Nexus, the Goblin Market can be used to travel around the world at tremendous speed (albeit only to specific places linked by the mirrors in it). Some Mirror Nexuses are basically unknown, which means that unlike the Goblin Market, a character cannot go there in order to do shady commerce or perform some sort of information gathering montage. However, these have the added advantage that the characters can travel through them without being seen by dozens of Trolls and hundreds of Mirror Goblins who are all of dubious and negotiable loyalties. Any of the handful of Mirror Nexuses, whether currently occupied or not, constitutes a Rating 4 Destiny.

### Yggdrasil
It is the greatest tree, from whence dreams of power come. And it has roots in the dreams of all who wield authority. Yggdrasil is a towering tree of specifically indeterminate type. It grows somewhere in the Deep Maya, and it is taller than the limits of vision in that strange place. Supposedly it is somehow watered by the _idea_ of authority, and drinking its sap or eating its seeds gives one delusions of might. The Deep Maya is pretty locationally unstable, and when in the presence of the mighty arboreal construct this property is exacerbated - returning to the world of mortals could leave one anywhere. At least, anywhere that there are people sleeping who hold power over others.

Climbing its branches you can end up in the location of any source of temporal power where people are sleeping nearby. So you can pop into the White House in the middle of the night or into the Indian Parliament during a particularly boring speech. By climbing the tree with deliberate intention, one can arrange to end up near a specific hall of power (such as the Tienanmen Square Parliament Building or the Covenant Grand Chapel in Rome), but not to the extent of showing up in a specific person's bedroom. The accuracy is to within a couple dozen meters, and when the character appears in the mortal world they seem to simply mist in. The seeds and sap of the tree are poisonous and cause delusions of grandeur. But they are also extremely valuable in a number of special Bitter Fruit recipes, and can be used to make potions that sap the will, inspire loyalty, or make someone appear physically attractive. Yggdrasil is a Rating 6 Destiny.

## Things
_Is that what I think it is? I thought it was only a legend!_

After Sundown uses roughly the same system of magic item creation as Dwarf Fortress. People periodically get overtaken by strange moods (or macabre or fey moods as the case may be), and then they gather weird materials together, lock themselves in a workshop, and make a perplexing masterpiece. This masterpiece is generally of surpassing quality and thus considerable value as an object of art or history, and also frequently cursed.

### The Necronomicon
It's a creepy tome that is filled with demonic magic. Each page is velum with a brown ink that could seriously be blood forming its writings in a mad and tangled hand. Those who read from its dread pages gain dark insight and go mad. Sometimes in that order.

Magic tomes are pretty common as rare and unique magical objects go. What they basically _do_ is let someone who studies them for extended periods of time learn some sort of evil sorcery. This has the clearest effect of giving a character an excuse to learn a couple of sorcerous disciplines, so that if they are afforded the opportunity to learn a sorcerous discipline, they can choose to pursue one of the sorcerous disciplines described in the pages. Magic tomes have additional effects when they are read by humans. Luminaries can turn into Witches, and Extras become cultists. Generally, a major magic tome will cover two or three sorcerous paths, and convert Luminaries into the most closely associated kind of Witch. The Necronomicon itself covers the Descent of Entropy, the Progress of Glass, and the Song of Swarms. Luminaries who read it become Baali. Other Infernal grimoires include _De Vermis Mysteriis_, _The Bible Black_, _The Book of Nod_, and _Unaussprechlichen Kulten_; while Orphic grimoires that can change a man into a Khaibit include _Secrets of Life and Death_, _Cultes de Ghoules_, _Beyond the Setting Sun_, and _The Book of the Dead_; and Astral grimoires that can transform a Luminary into a Dryad include _The King in Yellow_, _Allessehen Auge_, _The Endless Nightmare_, or _The Voynich Manuscript_.

Any of these books is a Rating 1 Destiny, as is any similar book you make for your campaign.

### Shamshir-e Zomorrodnegar
It's a scimitar whose hilt is encrusted with emeralds. It has been prophesied that it alone can fell the great Efreet Fulad-zereh, and that it will inevitably do so. Needless to say, pretty much everyone who takes an especial interest in the wellbeing of Fulad-zereh (for good or ill) wants to have control this scimitar. There are of course _numerous_ weapons out there that are the fated killers of various powerful supernatural monsters. Carnwennan the dagger, Clarent the sword, and Luin the spear were all famously used to slay various specific beings. But only the  Shamshir-e Zomorrodnegar is fated to kill Fulad-zereh.

These weapons have several properties that are of especial interest to the creature they are targeted against. The first is that they cause aggravated damage to the creature in question and ignore the soak bonuses of the target's Powers _and Edge_. The second is that if they are used to attack their destined foe, the attacker gains +3 dice on all attacks. The third is that when a character holds the weapon, they know where the targeted foe is as if they were being _summoned_ whenever they speak the creature's name. No creature has more than one fated bane weapon targeted against them at a time, and they are usually reticent to destroy it because if they do so outside of the auspices of a specific mighty ritual of vast power, another weapon _somewhere in the worlds_ instantly gains that property.

Shamshir-e Zomorrodnegar, or any bane weapon, is a Rating 1 Destiny.

### The Legacy of Thomas Craine
The room is full of books. Dusty old tomes filled with mildewed pages and cryptic writings from generations of goetic researches. There are numerous falsehoods in their crinkled pages, and yet there are some quite poignant discussions on the land of the dead. Many of the books are penned by Thomas Craine himself - some of them when he was still alive.

A magical library generally contains the source material for five sorcerous disciplines. In the case of Thomas Craine's Legacy, it contains all paths of Orphic Sorcery. But beyond that, one can do library research in such an environment, giving it a substantial edge in identifying things over any single enchanted tome. The Legacy is a good place to research locations and inhabitants of Mictlan.

A Magical Library is a rating 2 Destiny.

### The Wings of Needless Sorrow
It is an amulet made of obsidian that has been cut to resemble a stylized bird in flight. The Wings are filled with hatred, and are drawn to suffering. The bearer of the amulet will see calamity after calamity, with the sick and dying plaguing their existence like a literal disease of which they cannot be cured.

The amulet senses the future, is evil, and subtly adjusts the bearer's behavior so that the amulet is brought into contact with as many crimes, accidents, and human misery as possible. If the bearer has the opportunity to take two different routes to the convenience store, they will _always_ end up choosing the one where they witness a traffic accident. This sort of thing can actually be immensely useful to a Scooby Gang, since they can just have the bearer point to a road map at random and they'll end up driving to a place their skills are needed.

The Wings of Needless Sorrow are a rating 2 Destiny.

### The Bull of Despondent Glory
It is a scroll of vellum made from human skin and written in a dense Latin script. Supposedly it was written up by the Covenant Anti-Pope Typhus II in the 11th century. Much of the second half is completely illegible, but as time goes by it _sharpens_, and words can be discerned. 
The Bull of Despondent Glory is a True Prophesy. That means that a bunch of things that are written in it _will_ come true, and a bunch of things _have_ come true. Entries appear in it irregularly, but when important stuff is going on, a number of entries may come to focus all at once. While it is a True Prophesy, some of the events described did not (at least apparently) actually happen as predicted. Still, with an accuracy above 80%, it's pretty uncanny. And not a few supernatural creatures believe that it is _always_ right and that history is merely wrong (or perhaps deliberately obfuscated) in those instances where history and the Bull conflict.

The Bull of Despondent Glory is a rating 3 Destiny.

### Preah Khan
It's a jewel and pearl encrusted broadsword of clear quality. The blade is a dull and dark gray as heavily tarnished silver, but the blade is sharp enough to shave with and does not appear to need sharpening. Legend has it that the metal was forged out of naga venom somehow and that it is still toxic. But the big thing is that owning it makes you the rightful king of Cambodia. Whoever holds the sword to the banks of the Mekong can make the river shrivel, swell, or even flow backwards. This sort of grotesque displays of magic are generally frowned upon by the World Crime League, and not a few supernatural creatures want the Preah Khan to stay missing.Preah Khan is an excellent sword, inflicting a base 3 damage, and every wound it inflicts is aggravated (even to mortal people). Khmer people will treat the holder as if they had the status of a king even if they do not know why. Even if they aren't even Cambodia, the wielder of Preah Khan can get the royal treatment in donut shops all over the Bay Area. And then there's the whole "controlling the Mekong River" thing. If word gets out that someone has Preah Khan, the owner can expect numerous enemies.

Preah Khan is a Rating 4 Destiny _and_ comes with Rating 4 Stalkers.
