# Terrible Places
_"When you say 'the world' do you mean 'Earth', or 'where we are now'?"_

After Sundown takes place in a world with many similarities to our own. A world which has the same countries and cities as the ones we are familiar with, and which is therefore one which you can research by reading about actual places in history and physical space. But it is also secretly full of magic and evil and beasts and slashers from horror fiction. It also has connections to three coterminous magic worlds full of monsters and danger.

It is in short: a game that takes place in the realm of horror rather than the realm of the real. You're playing a cooperative storytelling game, and the genre is horror. It may be action-horror, horror-mystery, horror-comedy, or even horror-romance, but it is always horror.

## A Life in Horror: The Good and The Bad
_"Interesting fact: The Final Girl trope emerged shortly after young women became a major component of horror movie attendees."_

Life for the common man in After Sundown is actually pretty horrible, and extremely dangerous. Life in After Sundown is life in a horror movie. Or rather, it is a world not unlike Earth would be if all the horror movies were real in different places and at different times. This means that body counts are extremely high, and it is very difficult to get help. This is good news if you happen to be the Bogie Man, but really bad for anyone looking for a life of vaguely normal properties. Here are some important things to remember:

* **The Police are no help at all.** Heavily infiltrated by cultists and secret societies, the police in After Sundown are astoundingly ineffective. Sure they will _occasionally_ bring down a killer, but the vast majority of crimes go unsolved. Many crimes don't even get investigated, especially if something supernatural is afoot.
* **Telecommunications are Shoddy.** Sat Phones aren't generally available in the realm of horror. Cellphone coverage cuts out constantly at inopportune moments. Most people still have landlines, but regular telecommunication wires go down frequently and are out for days at a time. The inability to get a call out of a building or town isn't unusual, that kind of thing happens a lot in After Sundown.
* **People Don't Travel Much.** It's not _weird_ for people to not know what goes on in the next town over in After Sundown. Things are just more dangerous, and people keep to themselves more.

Keep this in mind when you're planning your nights in the realm of horror. Life is less connected to other life in the realm of horror and it is _much_ easier for dangerous elements to thrive in such an environment.

That being said, it is important to remember that most horror movies begin with people thinking things are pretty normal, and _end_ with something of a return to normalcy as well (or do they?) So it's not like Jason is running around the streets murdering people left and right. Indeed, while the death rate from serial and mass murder is large enough in the realm of horror to compete with traffic accidents or opiate abuse, the fact is that you're still more likely to die from cancer. Supernatural creatures remain hidden and the president of the United States is openly a mundane human. A vampire can't just flash their fangs to get free entry to a movie theater, and indeed they could be in a lot of trouble if they flash their fangs in a public space of any kind.

## The Four Worlds
_"Things are crawling in all over the place these days."_

A very common trope in horror is the inclusion of additional worlds that are full of terror and danger. This is very useful, since of course having an extra world around allows you to fit things into the narrative that would be otherwise very difficult to fit into the Earth. Demon armies, forgotten cities, and strange and deadly plants can be piled to the sky and beyond without otherwise upsetting the world provided that they were never in the world in the first place. Furthermore, the idea that monsters can come in sideways is by itself a wonderfully useful notion for the horror genre, because it severely undermines the concept of safety in a fortress or locked room.

That being said, it is also true that there are a lot of alternate worlds to be had in various stories. Too _many_ alternate worlds to be anything vaguely approaching something workable. And so it is that as a compromise we have cut things down to three alternate realities:

* **Maya: The Dreamlands** Think of a combination of the untamed and deadly dreamworlds of [Jumanji](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113497/) or [Where the Wild Things Are](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386117/). This is where dreams and wild things go, but since this is the realm of horror the dreams are often as not inspired by Freddy and the beasts are likely to be deadly and destructive monsters.
* **Limbo: The Dark Reflection** The best rendition of the Dark Reflection is probably in [Silent Hill](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384537/). It's a world very much like our own but scoured with demonic powers. Ash falls from the sky like rain and everything looks abandoned or scorched. Demons prowl the Dark Reflection.
* **Mictlan: The Gloom** The best rendition of the Gloom is of course in [Night Watch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403358/), which even calls the place that. It's a cold and oppressive world where darkness presses insistently upon the light and heat of travelers. Powers of death leak in from every crevice and extinguish fires and the lives of small animals. Blood hungering insects and ghosts scour the Gloom.
* **The Mortal World** This is the world where most people live. It's just like our world except magic and monsters are real. And it's connected to the three other worlds. It is portrayed in virtually every horror movie because it _is_ the world of every horror movie.

Each of these worlds have two levels. One can go to the first level where interaction with the mortal realm is still possible, and one can go to the deeper level where it is not. In short, like in _Silent Hill_, it is possible to straddle the worlds where you can still open and close the door of your house and see what's on the stove but demons from the Dark Reflection can attack you. It's also possible to be all the way in the Dark Reflection, where things are a terrifying hellscape and nothing makes any sense. While in the Shallows of any of the worlds, the celestial realities of Earth appear to hold sway - the Sun rises and sets while wind and rain appear on schedule. In the Deeps, it becomes apparent that one is quite likely _not on Earth_, as the sky itself betrays one to be on an alien rock.

## Maya: The Dreamlands
_"Everybody's got to dream, young girl. If you don't dream, ya go crazy."<br />
"Go crazy? Don't mind if I do!"_

The Dreamlands are a wild and inhospitable place filled with fetid jungles and monstrous beasts. Overgrown with dreadful, implacable, and nightmarish life in all world correspondences - even those in the far north and south of the planet (though it still gets wicked cold at extreme latitudes). No one really knows if Maya is a construct of subconscious thought or the manifestation of a distant world that exists independently of our own. What is clear is that Maya is _connected_ to the dreams of the frightened and the suffering. The goings on in this world seem somewhat unreal even for those who have traveled to it in the flesh, and the native inhabitants are strange and otherworldly even by the standards set by other supernatural creatures.

The Deep Maya does not even have climactic similarities with its Mortal World correspondences. It boasts floating rocks and sideways waterfalls. And monstrous beasts. And psychic plants. There are few reasons for the sane to want to go to the Deep Maya even though it is wondrous and beautiful in its alien and unforgiving fashion. The weather is pretty similar to that of the Yucatan, with dense cloud cover and hot, driving rain falling almost every day. On those rare times that the night sky is visible, it is clear that the stars above are unfamiliar. The sky boasts no sun or moon, so where precisely the light comes from in the "daytime" is a matter of speculation.

### Getting to Maya
_"If you die in your dreams, you make me a sandwich."_

Perhaps the easiest way to get to The Dreamlands is to _go to sleep_. While not even a small fraction of dreamers are transported across the barrier, it is nonetheless possible for virtually anyone to make the passage while they are sleeping. A dreamer's physical body remains where it is while the consciousness projects into Maya. If the person dies in the Dreamlands, the body dies as well. If the body dies, the dreamer is lost in Maya indefinitely and becomes a Jalus. There are places where the barrier between Maya and the sleeping mind is weaker. Generally speaking, places with horrible _personal_ murders are more conducive to slipping people across into the nightmare realm. Impersonal deaths, such as natural disasters and battles make the barrier more difficult to cross. Physical gateways, though rare, also exist. They are always circles of something, and one crosses the boundary by entering and then exiting the circle. Circles of mushrooms or trees are fairly common as gateways go, but theoretically it could be a circle of anything. In any case, these gateways only function when the moon is visible. Sorcerous means of entering the Dreamlands are found in Astral Sorceries.

### Things to do in The Dreamlands
_"We shall build a tower that shall reach to the stars."_

The majority of inhabitants of Maya are neither human nor derived from human stock. Massive monsters stalk the lands and even the plants themselves chitter with an otherworldly malevolence. The Evil Plants in Maya speak to travelers only infrequently. Some can speak telepathically, but they mostly choose not to do so. The Giant Animals generally simply attempt to devour anything they come across. While delicious (if alien) fruit and clearish water are available year round and in great quantity, The Dreamlands have the least expatriate civilization from the Mortal world of all the other worlds.

Not everything in this dimension is from another world however. Sometimes tribes of Jalus congregate together. And for reasons unknown The Marduk Society has been growing an Arcanotower in the Brasil Correspondence for some time. They patrol that area and keep it [i]mostly[/i] clear of Giant Animals, but at least some Evil Plants seem to be allowed free reign to enter the transdimensional compound. 

## Limbo: The Dark Reflection
_"You can go to hell!"<br />
"We can't. Not alone..."_

A long time ago, some people fucked up really bad and parts of the human world started to fall into the fires of The Dark Reflection. Nobody's quite sure exactly when or what - some say that it was the cinders of the atomic fires of Oklo, while others say it is the ancient truth contained in the myth of Prometheus and the Scriptural references to Gehenna; some that men merely merely opened the doorway into the world of ashes; others say that it was men that started the unquenchable fire that begat The Dark Reflection. 

Practically everything found in Limbo was first wrought by humans, and then destroyed by fire. Everywhere in the Dark Reflection there are always remnants of human habitation, and everywhere in the dark reflection, there are always smoke and ashes. Yet it is exceedingly rare to encounter men still living nor open flames still burning. The ground is littered with sooty broken glass: smashed bottles, shattered windows, and  shards of obsidian lie on every surface. The dusty surfaces seem dull, and rarely cast a reflection. When they do, they seem more of a window back to the mortal realm, a cruel reminder of where the onlooker is and where they could be. The sky is perpetually obscured by oppressive smoke and rain falls only infrequently (in many places less than once a year) and it is black with ash when it lands.

The Dark Reflection knows neither day nor night, and languishes eternally in a twilight illumination that comes from between one and four vaguely definable lighter patches in the sky that may well be suns or moons. Limbo is home to what the unenlightened would call demons, ifrit, and shinma. All of them endeavor merely to survive long enough to escape. Survival is a brutal matter of scavenging amongst the cinders and preying upon the weaker residents. Escape is more difficult, never more than a temporary respite: for each of the dwellers of The Dark Reflection carry the seed of the unquenchable fire within them, and any who escape are doomed to one day start a blaze which will drag another piece of the human world back into The Dark Reflection.

## Getting to the Dark Reflection
_"Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens."_

Natural passage in and out of the Dark Reflection is almost always through fires or mirrored surfaces, and it is the latter possibility that gives it its name. Sometimes when something is burned, a rend between the mortal world and the Dark Reflection is left in its place. This is most likely to happen when the burnt thing in question was a source of security such as the wall of a family home or school, or a child's blanket. Once a character has been to the Dark Reflection even once, these portals appear far more commonly in their presence for the rest of their lives. Those who have been to the Dark Reflection often find themselves avoiding mirrors for fear that they will find the profane staring back at them.

Sorcerous means to enter and escape the Dark Reflection can be found in most Infernal paths. Leaving the Dark Reflection is difficult for magical creatures. Whether traveling by sorcery or through a gateway, moving from the Deep to the Shallow or from the Shallow to the Mortal World requires one to make a make a Resistance Test (Social if attempting to traverse a summoning, Mental if attempting to pass through a mirror gate, or Physical if attempting to navigate a burnt rend in space) with a Threshold equal to their own Potency. If returning to a known place, the MC may award a bonus of 1-5 dice to the escape attempt depending upon _how_ familiar one is with the location. Summoning rituals and special gate preparations can add additional bonus dice in addition to allowing for an Escape Test at all. The property of being difficult to leave is called "The Gauntlet," and it can render the Dark Reflection a near inescapable prison for the very powerful. For example, The King With Three Shadows has a Potency of 10 and suffers from a _name binding_ that further raises his escape threshold to 15. The locations of truly epic firestorms have left certain portals that waive these restrictions for supernatural creatures of a Potency equal to or less than their Rating.

### Things to do in Limbo
_"It's being invaded by the Otherworld. By a world of someone's nightmarish delusions come to life."_

The majority of natives of the Dark Reflection are Fey and Demons. These beings are generally pretty uncooperative and rarely are on good terms with any of the major Syndicates. The King with Three Shadows has a strong presence in Limbo, and his Syndicate has substantially more territory than any other there. World War II created copies virtually intact of several cities in Limbo, and many of them are used by one or more supernatural groups as bases of operation. The firestorms of Dresden created a dusty and scorched copy of that place in the Dark Reflection which is even now used by members of the Covenant who refused to accept the defeat of the Axis as a base of operation to train a demon army to someday retake the human world. The Rape of Nanking left a level 5 portal to a reflection of the city of Nanjing that is mostly used as a smuggling port by the World Crime League.

Not everything in Limbo is a supernatural creature. There are some real humans there, and they are sad people. Food is scarce in the Dark Reflection, and the nightmarish imagery is usually enough to drive those who fall into Limbo to madness and depravity. Most become demonic pawns. However, demonic pawn or not, a human has no Potency and can pass through the narrowest of portals. All too often, by the time they reach an egress they are already committed to serving dark lords by kidnapping other humans from the mortal world and then [i]returning[/i] to the land of their torment.

## Mictlan: The Gloom
_"Some people believe that when you die there is a wonderful light. As bright as the sun but it doesn't hurt to look into it. All the answers to all the questions you want to know are inside that light. Truth is... there is no light. Only darkness."_

The Gloom has been around forever. Some say that it is space itself and the big bang created the human world as a tiny mote within the Gloom, while others say that the Gloom is the force of entropy to which all things shall return in The End. Whatever the case, The Gloom is supernaturally cold and dark. The ground is bare and everything that lives within The Gloom is hungry all of the time. What plants there are lack essential nutrients and sunlight and cannot grow without blood. All the insects are parasitic.

There are no visible stars in the Deep Gloom. There is no sun in the morning, and no glittering lights in the night. There _may_ be a moon in the sky, but since it is as fixedly black as anything else in the sky it's a matter of debate. Rain never falls and the seas are deathly still. But water and other things rise up out of the ground at unpredictable times through a process called "welling". If you want light in Mictlan, you need to bring it yourself, and even then the illumination cast by a lamp or flashlight is disappointing, as if the air itself were a voracious shadow.

The Gloom is home to what the unenlightened would call ghosts, wendigos, and zombies. All of them endeavor to draw prey in from the human world where they may drain the blood, life, and warmth from it to feed their insatiable hungers. The true horror is that such victims do not rest in peace, but instead rise driven by the need to recover the blood, life and warmth that was taken from them - in an ever growing cycle of futility. 

### Getting to Mictlan
_"Have you ever been killed before? I'll be back in a minute."_

Portals to The Gloom are called "wells" and each one is filled with darkness. The most effective portals are holes in the ground filled with shadow and water - literal wells. However in some cases a well will appear which is _just_ a hole filled with water _or_ shadow. In addition, pretty much everyone goes to Mictlan just by dying. Upon death, a person becomes a ghost, but in most cases they don't seem to last very long. While some ghosts (especially the ghosts of Luminaries) kick around pretty much indefinitely, this being the realm of horror it seems most likely that ghosts simply unravel and fade into oblivion. The land of the dead is indeed a super depressing place. Sorcerous means of entering The Gloom are found in Orphic magic paths.

While in the Deeper Gloom, all Ghosts are solid, able to be seen and to exert force upon objects. In the Shallow Gloom and to an even greater extent in the mortal world this is not reliably true. So it is that many Ghosts essentially cannot get anything done in the mortal world even if they escape Mictlan through a Well. So while there is no barrier to exit The Gloom as there is for the Dark Reflection, the primary residents mostly do not leave even when they can.

### Things to do in The Gloom
_"It was their hands that built this city of ours, Father. But where do the hands belong in your scheme?"<br />
"In their proper place, the depths."_

Soulless bodies sink into Mictlan fairly regularly, whereupon they are animated by the hungry energies of The Gloom and become wandering zombies. The dusty plains of Mictlan are pretty dangerous for travelers because of this. The Gloom has been around for a long time, and walls erected don't seem to fall down often in the cold stillness of the land of eternal night. Over the millennia many people have found time to erect buildings and even cities. Many of these stand vacant, mute testament to the fact that long ago someone cared enough to build them. However, some are still in use. The Shattered Empire has several such cities, usually corresponding to places where no city or even point of interest stands in the Mortal World. Others are less ambitious, where the Ulmi family have a castle in the Gloom Shadow of Venice.

There does not appear to be any specific fixed limit to how long a Ghost can persist in The Gloom. So even though most last only very short amounts of time, it is entirely possible that any particular historical figure still exists somewhere in Mictlan. Some Ghosts, unhappy with the idea of wandering through a frozen desert for all eternity have taken the time to put up buildings and even societies. The largest such Ancestor City is at about the same place as Beijing.

## Being In Between Worlds
_You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here._

In the real world, there is pretty much only one universe you can exist in, and so being in multiple different worlds can be hard to imagine. Here are the states of being one can have:

### In the Mortal World

This is precisely like being in the universe is for those of us outside the game. A character in the mortal world is safe from attack from things in other worlds, and cannot be physically affected by them. Normal people cannot perceive or touch things in other worlds while they are in the Mortal World. Some disciplines allow characters to perceive, but not touch, things that are in the Shallows of other worlds. So for example, if your character has Necromancy, they can perceive goings-on in the Shallow Gloom, but they are still safe from physically being harmed by creatures or objects there. When a character moves completely from one world to another, they come out in the nearest place that they can fit, which in some cases will be several meters away from their relative location in the original world.

### In the Shallows

The Shallows of any world are very similar to the Mortal World, and appear to be a compromise of sorts. While a character is in the Shallows, they are essentially in what appears to be a copy of Earth with strange decor, more monsters, and a _lot_ less people. The basic lay of the land, including placement and layout of buildings, is almost exactly the same, although there is generally speaking less stuff. 

### In the Deeps

The Deeps of any world are just completely crazy, and in no way similar to the Mortal World. While there are objects that have been transported or copied from the Mortal World to the Deeps, by and large the Deeps are their own alien wildernesses.

### Between Worlds

One can occupy both the mortal world and the Shallows of another world, or the Shallows and the Deeps of another world simultaneously. This usually happens while a character is physically in a Bleed (see below), but may also occur during travel from one world to another. Since floors and tables tend to be in the same places in both versions of the world, characters can usually navigate just fine while perceiving and interacting with objects in both worlds simultaneously. The character will appear to be hallucinating to observers from either reality (who aren't also in the Bleed or whatever), because there are things (most especially creatures) that are in only one world and not the other. An effect cannot extend a character into a solid object in the other world, so if a character is standing in empty space in the Shallow Gloom and there's a big pile of sand there in the Mortal World, an event like a convergence or an ability like Shadow Gate would simply fail.

Existence in two worlds is inherently unstable, and is limited in both time and space. If a character moves far enough from their current position or waits for enough time to pass, they _will_ end up in one world or the other. And _which_ world they end up in is not always predictable (although if the character is in Limbo, they must pass the Gauntlet to end up in more Earthly surroundings). But while a character is between worlds, both prying eyes and bullets from either world can reach them.

### Bleeds

There are places where the worlds merge, where a character is literally in two worlds because the ground itself is in two worlds. The experience of this is no different than being in just one world at a time, because in such places there is really only one table in the room. And while said table may be in the style of an Earthly table or a table of Limbo, it will still be a single solid object. Where things get weird is at the edges of the Bleed, where a character inside may see two different outsides. Bleeds have a tendency to oscillate between sending those who leave to one world or the other. Sometimes this is very simple (such as opening a door onto either a blighted hellscape or a normal suburban street), and sometimes it's just plain hard to figure out (such as the difference between a foggy forest and a foggy forest that happens to be in Maya). 

## Terrible People
_Have you gotten a look at the neighbors?_

The realm of horror described in After Sundown is not merely the existence of nightmare worlds from which danger constantly leaks in to disrupt suburban homemaking, it also has people in it. People who are major characters and people who are the victims in slasher flicks. Sometimes, these are the same people.

### People in Horror: Extras and Luminaries
_"Do not run upstairs! There is no exit upstairs!"_

Remember that in horror movies there are a lot of people who serve no real purpose save to be eaten by the monsters. We call them Extras even if they happen to get some lines. These people may be strong, or smart, or beautiful, but ultimately they are doomed. If they get bitten by a zombie they will turn into one of the shambling hordes that our heroes must eventually chop through with a chain saw. They will not get cured and will not turn into leaders of the walking dead. Game mechanically, these people have no Edge score. If they turn into a supernatural creature of some kind they will become a _Spawn_. These hapless victims will not become the next Dracula, they will always be the horde vampires in [From Dusk Till Dawn](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/). They will not become Shelly Winters or Sheila, they will join the hordes of deadites and get cleaved through with fire.

On the other side of the coin, there _are_ people in the horror genre who rise to the occasion. Whether they are introduced as bad ass adventurers like Van Helsing or Rick O'Connell, or are "normal people" who rise to the occasion like Meg Penny or Ash, these people have a certain spark of bad assery in them regardless of what they happen to be doing. They are _Luminaries_, and they have Edge. If they become Supernaturals they become the real deal. They may turn evil but they will still have lines and character development.

This is why characters will occasionally fight their way through a horde of zombies (who are of course _all_ ex-humans) just to try to get a cure for one woman who happens to have been turned into a zombie. It isn't that they've completely lost perspective, it's that the transformation into a monster is a one way trip for absolutely everyone except a reasonably small number of luminaries. You actually can "save" Alice or Sheila if they get transformed into the living dead. There's literally nothing you can do for the rest of the people except shoot them in the face.

### The Playable Types

The Universal Monsters have a lot of stuff in there which is not really appropriate for emulation. Sure, Lon Chaney is full of awesome and I have no problem watching his movies, but neither the [Phantom of the Opera](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016220/) nor the [Hunchback of Notre Dame](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0014142/) is especially supernatural. They are both just really creepy guys. On the other end of the spectrum, the existence of space aliens really harms the whole eldritch intrigue thing. So while [This Island Earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047577/) is a good movie and part of the official pantheon, the Metalunans and Zagons are not going to be part of this. At all.

Which leaves Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, Gillman, the Mummy, and the Wolfman - who all appear in the motion picture classic [The Monster Squad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560/), and the Evil Wizard, the Invisible Man, and the Mole Man - who don't. It is of note however that Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman, and the Invisible Man all appear in the equally mandatory movie [Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040068/), and there is of course Evil Wizard and Mummy in the substantially less mandatory [Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047795/). It seems clear that life would go on without Mole Men, but _what the heck?_ We've got Mole Man in After Sundown, we call them Troglodytes.

#### Vampires
_An eternity of melancholy and betrayal is, after all, an eternity._

The Vampire is a rockstar of the living dead. They drink blood, live forever, and look great in black. Vampires are emotionally attenuated individuals who have to consume metaphorical life in the form of actual human blood. They are parasites whose very existence is a powerful metaphor for the consumptive and conflict-torn nature of the world.

**Exemplars:** [Dracula](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021814/). Did we mention _Dracula_? I mean sure, we can talk about the vampires from [Blade](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611/) or [Buffy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/), and we will even. But all Vampire mythos in the modern world always comes back to Dracula, because he is that awesome. And a special "also-ran" to the beast from [Nosferatu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/), because he is also awesome.

#### Animates
_Once created, a work has a life of its own._

An Animate is an artificial person. Created by unwise science, magic, or both, each Animate is a race of one. They have no peers and no possibility of children. Every Animate is created knowing that their entire people dies with them. It is a lonely and frightening existence. The Animate story is classically one that exists to explore the tragedy of dysfunctional human relationships - whether it be a child scorned by their parents, a lover scorned by the object of their affection, or simply a working person cast aside by those they worked for. The book Frankenstein explores much the same themes as a Bruce Springsteen album.

**Exemplars:** [Frankenstein's Monster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021884/), [Rotwang's Robot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/), [Loew's Golem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague)

#### Lycanthropes
_Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night...<br />
may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright._

A Lycanthrope is someone who is cursed to transform into a rampaging beast when the moon is full or they get excited. There is plenty of mythological basis for shapeshifters who are born with the ability to turn into animals or who have attained the magic powers to do so to protect mankind, but they aren't normally figures from _horror_ stories, and have no place in horror and are not represented in After Sundown. Being a Lycanthrope means that you are a danger to people you love and the furniture around you. You can unleash the beast to rip things to pieces, but lycanthropy is a _curse_ and it is not generally very fun.

**Exemplars:** [John Talbot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034398/), [Irena Dubrovna](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034587/), [Yuki Sohma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Sohma)

#### Witches
_Bubble Bubble._

Witches are people who have learned Magic. In a horror setting, magic is in almost all cases bad. The genre is pretty light on Glinda the Goods and Merlins. Magicians are generally vindictive cackling gypsies, satanic sorcerers, mysterious strangers, and a myriad of other titles both hackneyed and terrifying. They spend a lot more time sacrificing people to gods ancient and evil and a lot less time preparing good children to go to the ball than magicians in other genres.

Magic that humans can use comes from three sources in After Sundown. There is the magic of Death, which is evil. There is Devil magic, which is evil. And finally there is the twisted sorceries of Nightmares, and that's evil as well. It's not that you can't do good as a magician, you totally can. It's just that the magic itself is evil and using it is dangerous even if you are the virtuous [Chandu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022753/). The horror movies of the 30s didn't distinguish particularly between people from India and China (both were in "The East"), and we hearken to that slightly by leaving all traditions of magic as variations of the basic three. While a character may well be a voodoo death magician or an Aztec or Egyptian death magician, the magical set is all the same. Death magic is death magic whether you call upon bones with Chinese runes or African chants.

An important thing to realize is that The Mummy is actually a Witch.  That's just how they do immortality. Sometimes it's an immortality where you do evil magic and you look like a normal person (see the [1933](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023245/) _or_ [1999](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/) The Mummy) and sometimes you look like a crazy corpse in special bandages (like in [Bubba Ho-Tep](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281686/)). It really depends. Either way, if you want to be a leftover from Egypt or Aztlan you are a Witch (or a Vampire of course). However, and this is important, the Mummies from the middle Mummy movies such as [The Mummy's Ghost](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037099/) and... sigh... [The Mummy's Curse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037098/), where the Mummy lurches around and smashes things, that Mummy is an Animate instead. So pick a schtick and go with it.

#### Transhuman
_Just a scientific experiment. To do something no other man in the world had done._

Humans do not, in general, have supernatural powers. However, in the horror genre there are a number of people who experience an event which changes them irrevocably into something different. Something _more_. These people generally go stark raving mad, and in not very long. The certainty that they are no longer human causes them to lose sight of human priorities, human morality. While they have become something more, they are also something _less_.

The transformational event can be scientific or magical. Or a bit of both. A Transhuman always has an "origin story" which is to some degree unique. [The Invisible Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024184/) took scientific chemicals. [Anck Su Namun](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0046350/) simply woke up one day and realized that she is the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess. [Ayesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_%28novel%29) stepped into the mystical _flame of life_ and stepped out an inhuman thing. Whatever the event was, it was the last thing that he or she did as a human, and the reality of that fact is as destructive to the self as the subsequent revelations of the magical world and the horrors which inhabit it.

#### Leviathan
_His face was fish-like._

Supposedly in pre-Sumerian times there was a great mother of monsters. Her name was Tiamat. Or Vritra. It's not really that important what her name was, because she was killed by a powerful human sorcerer around 4000 BCE, and most of her monstrous brood is gone as well. But not all of it. Some of them interbred with humans and hid their lineage in the darkest corners of the world. They hid from the world of men for millennia, some lurking in darkness and plotting revenge and others merely living their own lives - the ancient conflict long forgotten.

But that's not really possible now. Things are modern, and there is nowhere to hide. Those who carry the taint of Tiamat's spawn in their ancestry or are cursed with the taint during their lives are both hunted and feared. They are destructive, and eating their flesh can make you live forever. Of course, eating their flesh makes you like them, and puts you into the same danger. But hey, immortality.

In After Sundown, these creatures often hang out at the edges of society - places which while nominally explored aren't actually _watched_ very carefully.

### The Non-Playable Types

Not only must we make explicit what appears on the player's side, we also need to decide ahead of time what is around, supernaturally speaking _in the world_. Many people protest this. If they want to have unicorns show up for a storyline, why shouldn't they, as the MC, just do that? The answer is that in a cooperative storytelling game, the players need some sort of ground state to tell their own back stories and to make plans for future intrigue. Whether or not the _character_ knows that such and such a creature exists or such and such a world spanning organization is up to its evil schemes, the _player_ needs to at the very least have access to that information. And while it may seem like that would spoil surprises - and it does sometimes - in a much more important way it prevents _narrative dissonance_. Narrative dissonance appears in cooperative storytelling games much the way continuity errors appear in horror films. And while it is certainly jarring to watch the part in [Leprechaun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107387/) where they drive off in the second car despite the fact that they had earlier lamented being stranded when the first car wouldn't start - it is still a movie and thus the plot (such as it is) just keeps rolling along whether you notice the discrepancy or not. In a cooperative storytelling game however, such an event would just crash everything to a halt. The players and the MC would have to sit down and work something out, because they are all imagining the world together and there is no "next scene" until everyone gets their imaginations working together.

#### Zombies
_Brains!_

Zombies are the result of evil magic, ghastly diseases, or super science which transforms dead bodies into lurching, brain eating monsters. Zombies hunger for the living and have a tendency to rampage constantly. Some zombies are fast, some are slow. Some can figure out doorknobs and others can't. But they all hunger for the living. Zombie spawn can create new zombie spawn just by killing extras, so zombie outbreaks can get really big, really fast.

**Exemplars:** Shelly Winters, Sheila, [Ed](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478478/)

#### Fey
_Ha! Ha!_

Fairies in horror movies come from the same ghastly hell dimension that the demons do. These are _not_ the shimmering pixies from Neverland, these are the hideous flesh eating goblins from the Goblin Market. They come in small and extra large sizes, and are generally easy to confuse.

**Exemplars:** [The Leprechaun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107387/), [Rumplestiltskin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114306/), [Pan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/), [Pyramidhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Head)

#### Demons
_"My God!"<br />
"Not yet, human. Soon... very soon I will be."_

Made entirely of evil magic, the demons are a strange force that seeks to hurt humans and steal souls. Some appear as beautiful humans with or without horns and wings, and others look like the most nightmarish beasts the special effects budget could afford.

**Exemplars:** [Wishmaster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120524/), [Azazel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azazel_%28Marvel_Comics%29), Buju, The Lady in Red

#### Ghosts
_Boo!_

When humans die and they are _super pissed_ about something, they will occasionally linger on after death and become a ghost. Ghosts don't interact properly with physical objects and other people, and in any case are fed only by strong human emotions. So they gradually lose themselves and go batshit crazy, becoming a force that is more and more destructive.

**Exemplars:** [Slimer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097428/), [Patrick Swayze](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/), [The Mist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/)

#### Giant Animals
_Rar!_

The wilderness of horror is a dangerous place with a spectacularly large array of things that can kill you. Man eating beasts of tremendous size roam the woods, the lakes, the swamps, and probably the mountains. Being eaten by sharks, crocodiles, tigers, or _whatever_ is a severe threat. And yes, these super charged zoo rejects have magic powers sometimes.

**Exemplars:** [Jaws](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/), [Joe Young](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041650/), [Boa](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412523/), [Python](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412523/)

#### Evil Plants
_From now on, I'm shooting my salad **before** I eat it._

The evil plants grow out of the ground in weird pods that make the soundtrack want to bust out theremin tracks.  They grow out of humans and often have mind control and other weird powers. These things might actually _be_ from Space. But since they don't have a civilization or space ships (that we know of), it's not super important.

**Exemplars:** [Body Snatchers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106452/), [The Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/), [Swamp Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084745/)
