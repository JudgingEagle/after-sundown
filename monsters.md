# Monsters
_"Bullets! My only weakness!"_

Remember the 900+ page books about all these different creatures? You can find mythical sources which will back up pretty much any supernatural creature being weak or immune to pretty much anything you can imagine. Vampires who have to count seeds or are repulsed by sticky rice for example. There comes a time when you just have to buckle down and agree upon some basics or it's never going to generate stories. So up front we're going to talk about the basic things you use against supernaturals _in general_, and which ones are specifically effective against which types. Remember that each supernatural character fits into two categories: they are a supernatural type (vampire, lycanthrope, etc.), and they also have a power source (Astral, Infernal, or Orphic). Every _playable_ supernatural creature is available with every power source, and each type/power source combination represents a unique subtype. For example: an Astral Powered Vampire is a Nosferatu and an Infernal Powered Vampire is a Daeva. The _nonplayable_ supernatural creatures have subtypes as well, but they literally come from one of the other worlds and every subtype has the same power source. The subtypes are roughly broken down by power - a Triffid is more powerful than a Mantrap and a Pod is more powerful still. Note that while a good case can be made that the playable types are roughly equal to one another in overall utility, the same is not true at all for the nonplayable creatures. Indeed, an Ifrit or a Pod is not allowed for player characters in no small part because it's ridiculously powerful, while a Shambler is not up for grabs because it is weak even on the scale of competent normal humans.

## Slaying Monsters (in general)

You _can_ hurt just about anything by just running it over with a car. However, supernatural creatures have supernatural defenses that make them incredibly tough. There are a couple of universal weapons that cut through crap like regeneration and magic force fields. They are effective  based on the type of creature you are trying to kill. When used on the appropriate foe, these weapons inflict aggravated damage and negate soak bonuses from disciplines. Note that simply _having_ a high Strength with the aid of a power like Giant Size would not constitute a soak bonus, but that a specific soak bonus (including bonus armor) such those provided by Force Field or the passive benefit of Fortitude is negated.

### Wood

In many songs and stories, only special wood counts against the forces of darkness. Maybe it is oak, or banyan or sacred ash. But seriously it doesn't even matter. Wood represents life even when it is dead, dry, and laminated. It is effective against Animates, Vampires, Zombies, and Ghosts.

### Iron

Seriously, _Iron_. Like the stuff that your steel knives are already made out of. It's a symbol of modernity and industrialization and stuff and it classically drives away the old cthonic stuff. It is effective against Leviathan, Transhumans, Evil Plants, and Fey.

### Silver

Shiny and inconstant like the moon, silver is hard enough to kill a man and easy enough to cast that you can do it before the invention of bronze. Silver is clearly magical, and is lethal to creatures as ephemeral and primal as it is. It is effective against Witches, Lycanthropes, Giant Animals, and Demons.

## Weakening Supernatural Creatures

There are a lot of things which, while they won't burn the flesh of supernaturals, _will_ deplete their powers. They can be used to imprison some of these bad boys, or take their powers away long enough to beat them in a fight. When exposed to their particular kryptonite, a supernatural creature's powers are weakened in several ways:

* Their Potency is considered zero, and any of their attributes that are raised past their normal maximum are considered to be their normal maximum (usually 6 for former humans).
* They cannot spend Power Points, and any powers they activated this scene with Power Points already have no further effect for as long as the character's powers are suppressed.
* They cannot spend an action required to activate any power.

### Alcohol

It has to be very strong beer to count, but in general, if you get some good old fashioned spirits onto (or into) supernatural creatures they have a hard time using their powers. Consumed alcohol wears off in about an hour, alcohol spilled on a creature cleans up with club soda.

**Effective against:** Evil Plants,  Lycanthropes, Animates, Giant Animals 

### Water

Getting wet is a real problem for some evil beings. Unlike with alcohol, water vulnerabilities don't trigger in any way off of being _drunk_. The creature's powers are dampened only so long as their exterior is wet. Moderate dampness doesn't count either, we're talking half-liter or more Wicked Witch of the West _wet_ (and they don't even melt, they just can't spend power points and such).

**Effective against:** Demons, Witches, Transhumans, and Fey

### Sunlight

The harsh light of the day star robs evil creatures of their strength.

**Effective against:** Vampires, Ghosts, Zombies, and Leviathan

## Power Schedules
_"It's five o'clock, time for your ass whupping."_

Power Points are regained on a _schedule_ that varies depending on the type of supernatural creature. This means that different characters and enemies will need to do different things to restore their powers, which will occasionally come up as a substantial advantage or disadvantage for one character or another, depending upon the circumstances. Sometimes this can be forced against a character due to the needs of the plot, and other times the characters can figure out how to use the intricacies of their power regaining system.

Common Power Schedules include:

* **Feeding** - Characters who must feed upon mortals to regain power points have obvious advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, they can often schedule their power gains whenever. People are all over the place and you can take time out of your schedule to devour them whenever you aren't pressed for time. Of course, when you're in polite company or you _are_ pressed for time, that may not be possible. Also, leaving a trail of victims is a dangerous thing to do, even if you have the ability to wipe their memories - it angers people. It angers people who are luminaries. All vampire types are on the Feeding schedule. A character gains one Power Point for every lethal wound box inflicted with the character's idiom. You'll note that a victim always has 10 boxes, and even a starting character's Power Reserve goes up to 13. A character Feeding from a human (or supernal creature with living flesh) can take one Power Point for every wound inflicted, but mostly characters who want to go from empty to full will want to non-fatally feed from more than one mortal. Actual consumption of power points takes place at the rate of 1 power point every 12 seconds (1 turn during high resolution action scenes), and requires consumption during the entire period. The wound need not be inflicted in bite size pieces - it is entirely possible to cause someone a single Serious wound (6 boxes) and then lick the blood up for 72 seconds to gain 6 power points. Feeding from Vampires (as well as Revenants and Akuma) is _relatively_ non-harmful, as their living blood isn't really _theirs_ to begin with. In that case, power points can be drained out at a rate of 1 per 12 seconds without actually injuring the victim.
* **Lunar** - Characters who regain power points when the moon rises are able to pull fancy time shenanigans where their powers are restored fully in the middle of major scenes. Unfortunately, they also have to wait about an entire day between times when they get their powers back. A character on the Lunar power schedule fills their Power Reserve every time the Moon Rises. And yes, that can be a long wait at the North or South Poles. Try not to get imprisoned in those places.
* **Ritual** - Characters on the ritual schedule have a specific and time consuming action they have to perform in order to regain their power points. This takes substantially longer than feeding on a mortal (usually about 2 hours), but hopefully entails less personal risk than actually victimizing someone. The ritual required varies depending upon the type of character, but usually requires special equipment. For example: an Android needs to hook themselves up to special equipment in order to literally recharge their batteries while one of the Fallen has to bathe in the magical glow from their artifact. Special circumstances may be available to reduce the ritual time below the 2 hour standard. For example, an Android or Frankenstein could recharge _faster_ if they were hooked up to a giant hydroelectric dam than they could with their equipment hooked up to the normal power grid in their home.
* **Continuous** - Some creatures get their power on a continuous basis. These characters are at "full strength" scene after scene. They are narratively tireless, but have reduced power points to compensate. Creatures on the Continuous schedule enter every scene with half their Power Reserve filled. No playable creatures have a Continuous Power Schedule, but it's important to know that Trolls and the like _cannot_ be worn down. Creatures on a Continuous schedule do not gain power points while actually dead (essentially they do not get any more scenes), meaning that it may require the use of some Vampire Blood or something to revive a set of Troll bones.

## Tragic Flaws
_"It's not all turning into a giant homicidal monster, there are also parts of the curse that are genuinely bad."_

Being supernatural is not without its drawbacks. As you can plainly see from watching pretty much any horror movie _ever_, the life of a monster is filled with unfortunate conditions. The most painful of these are the crushing mental instabilities that come with the territory. Every supernatural being goes at least somewhat crazy, and is a danger to themselves and others. In game, this is represented by the Master Passions. Each character gets one if they are a supernatural creature. The precise way that any character goes mad is a deeply personal one, and players may (and should) select one that feels right for them. The suggested Master Passion for each supernatural creature type is just that - a suggestion. While it may be the most common Master Passion that dominates the lives of that kind of creature, there is nothing inherently weird about a Werewolf or Troglodyte that happens to spiral into madness in some other way. Nothing weirder than the fact that they _are_ a murderous inhuman monster with claws, anyway.

But there are other limitations that affect supernatural creatures in a more universal and less personal fashion. Every member of a single class of supernatural creature has a Distinctive Flaw, which is a Disadvantage common to their type of supernatural creature. The player does not normally get any choice in the matter, _every_ Werewolf has the Temperamental Disadvantage. The character does not gain any compensatory Advantages for this Distinctive Flaw. If someone becomes a supernatural creature and already has the Distinctive Flaw for the type they are becoming, then they must either gain a new Disadvantage (chosen to be appropriate to the character), or abandon one of their Advantages.

Master Passions and Disadvantages are in the Character Options & Motivations chapter.

## Evil Plants
_"There's no sense in getting killed by a plant."_

The lands of Maya are filled with strange foliage. But strangest of all is the foliage that harbors a deep hatred for people and animals. Possessed of an intelligence that is so wholly unlike those of humanity’s that they are difficult to measure, these plants are condemned universally as being "Evil" even by the jaded standards of supernatural society. Completely emotionless, Evil Plants are not motivated by passions and cannot be induced to frenzy nor convinced against a course of action with emotional argument of any kind.

### Mantraps
_"Feed Me!"_

Mantraps are essentially Aubrey the monster from Little Shop of Horrors or the carnivorous plants from Mario Brothers. They are able to move their giant mouth quite quickly, but they are rooted to the ground and cannot effectively give chase. Brutally effective ambush hunters, Mantraps try to eat animals whenever the opportunities arise.

Mantraps can't readily transport themselves across the land, let alone the borders between the dreamlands and the material world. Nevertheless, they do appear on Earth, because there are those who for whatever reason dig them up and transplant them. They often appear as guard plants in Marduk Society compounds. Mantraps can learn to speak, and their muppet like countenance creates alien voices.

The huge woody maw of a Mantrap is a damage 3 weapon. Mantraps have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:

S: 3/8 A: 1/4 I: 1/6 L: 1/3 W: 2/7 C: 1/4

A Mantrap has an Astral power source and a Feeding power schedule.

#### Mantrap Starting Powers

Core Discipline: Clout

* Clinging (Basic Clout)

- Basic Powers -

* Hide From Notice (Basic Veil)


### Triffids
_"I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is."_

The Triffids are mobile plant monsters that are only vaguely describable as humanoid in shape. Like other Evil Plants, they need meat in their diet, but unlike the others they can get up and walk at a normal speed. As such, Triffids are not relegated to ambush hunting, they can seriously chase their prey down and eat them. And they do.

A Triffid has a poison barb on the end of each meter long tendril that extends from their maw. Some of them sprout leaves and/or flowers from various parts of their body. Some of them are instead smooth like an ivy vine or wrinkled like a redwood tree. It's not entirely clear what the significance of that distinction is.

The vicious barbed tendrils of a Triffid constitute a damage 3 weapon that can deliver the poison of the Triffid's "bite". Triffids have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:

S: 3/8 A: 1/4 I: 1/6 L: 1/3 W: 2/7 C: 1/4

A Triffid has an Astral power source and a Lunar power schedule.

### Pods
_"There are others... they'll stop you!"<br >
"In an hour, you won't want them to."_

The Pods are psychic hazards that take over people and use them to make more pods and take more people over. It's a rather disturbing pyramid scheme, and it is not uncommon for even the Marduk Society and the Communes to work together in order to unravel Pod cults. It's not especially clear what it is that Pods _want_, but whatever it is, they appear to have no intention of discussing it with any political structures from the material world.

Each pod is roughly the size of a large watermelon and appears to be a massive green potato. Most pods have some milk white tendrils growing out of what is most probably the bottom. These look similar to the rootlets that grow out of a potato if you leave it in water for a long period of time. There are slight depressions all over the Pod that appear to be its "eyes" - they are able to see things through them and use Authority on victims who look at them. The tendrils of a Pod can only move by growing over the course of minutes and hours, so for any practical purposes they are essentially immobile. Pods have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:

S: 1/4 A: 0/0 I: 2/7 L: 2/7 W: 2/7 C: 1/6

A Pod has an Astral power source and a Lunar power schedule.

## Spawn Monsters
_That is a tragedy. You should probably kill it._

Supernaturals who aren't Luminaries are sad, monstrous things that have short life expectancies once the title sequence rolls. Not only do they have very limited supernatural powers but they are dominated by their Master Passion even more strongly than the true creatures they emulate. They suffer a -2 dicepool penalty when resisting or attempting to end a Frenzy. This penalty _rises_ over time. Spawn who are weak of will are simply in frenzy _all the time_. As such, Spawn monsters don't have much success in society, and are frequently simply kept locked up to be released on main characters like guard dogs or bees (or twisted combinations of the two).

### Vampire Spawn: Thralls
_"Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me!"_

Vampire spawn are monstrous and depraved, hungering for the blood of mortals and generally making a nuisance of themselves. All Vampire Spawn have Master Passion Hunger and like all spawn they have difficulty controlling it. Vampire Spawn have only Patience of the Mountains and Revive the Flesh for their disciplines. There is little tangible difference between a Nosferatu Spawn and a Daeva Spawn. Either could stand in for the nameless mook vampires that can be killed even by Xander in a Buffy episode. They still get the Feeding power schedule, but they have a Potency of zero that does not rise. Even hundreds of years later, taking down Dracula's clutch of bride thralls is not that much of a trick.

### Animate Spawn: Bots
_"Five is alive."_

Not all attempts to create life are truly successful. Without the spark of individuality, an animate machine is simply a machine that moves. Not necessarily a machine that thinks or _feels_. Depending upon its original purpose and the skill of construction, a non-luminary Animate has the stats of a Shambler or a Soulless. The only thing that really changes is the power source. When you open up a door and find a marching army of terracotta warriors, those have an Astral power source because they are technically Golem Spawn. Killer robots on the other hand, have an Infernal power source because they are Android Spawn. But in either case, the war thralls just use the stats of a Soulless. Golem and Android Spawn who are Soulless knock-offs have Patience of the Mountains, Nimble Feet, and Vigor (effectively replacing Bite of the Serpent with Patience of the Mountains). Frankensteins without the spark of a main character are _literally_ just a Shambler or a Soulless and don't replace any disciplines.

### Witch Spawn: Cultists
_"Uhluhtc! Uhluhtc!"_

Magic doesn't really work out very well for most people. Those who don't have the force of destiny and personality that comes with being a main character are frequently consumed by the power they attempt to wield. Becoming a cultist requires delving into the dark secrets and learning some magic. Maybe the Extra read a magic tome, maybe they got training from an actual spellcaster. Whatever the origin, they now have a basic Sorcery power or basic Authority and they start going completely insane. They are the proud recipient of Master Passion Greed, and they suffer the gradually increasing penalty to resisting its lure that afflicts spawn in general. Cultists do not inherently know how to get power points which depending upon what magic they learn, may not even matter. Cultists have a Potency of zero.

### Leviathan Spawn: Mutants
_"It's breakfast time!"_

The taint of Tiamat is a curse more than a blessing to most who are affected at all. While luminaries turn into badasses like Robert Olmstead, Extras with the blood appear to be normal humans _if they are lucky_. The less lucky ones become degenerate mutants who look all gross and want to eat people. They have a potency of zero and both Patience of the Mountains and Supernatural Senses. Unlike the paranoid true Leviathan, most Mutants end up with Master Passion Hunger or Master Passion Rage. This is also what happens to extras who eat the flesh of Leviathans. They become Leviathan spawn, gradually mutating into hideous monstrosities, and they are driven to eat people (especially other Leviathans). Some Leviathan communities keep these mutant throwbacks alive in locked up basements or attics.

### Transhuman Spawn: The Lost and the Damned
_"I don't believe in fate or destiny. I believe in various degrees of hatred, paranoia, and abandonment."_

Transhuman Spawn in many cases are not _exactly_ the same thing as regular Transhumans who are extras (and therefore doomed). But the concept is similar. A human Extra who is abandoned in the Dreamlands when their body dies becomes a Jalus: what is effectively an Icarid Spawn. They live out the rest of their lives in Maya, surviving day to day in that ghastly jungle mostly by dint of no one noticing them. Indeed, they have Hide From Notice. A human Extra who is adopted by spirits that aren't their own can be turned into a Seer. This is basically like being a Reborn Spawn, and while they get Summon Spirit, they _mostly_ get to be picked on by ghosts and go crazy. However, breaking the pattern, a human Extra who is imprisoned for an extended period in the Dark Reflection or who draws upon the power of an Infernal artifact gradually becomes a Fallen Spawn. They gain access to Learn the Heart's Pain and make up the majority of the human inhabitants of Limbo. In all cases, Transhuman Spawn are afflicted with Master Passion Despair, and for all the good it does them, they have the same power schedules as their associated Transhuman type.

### Lycanthrope Spawn: The Spawn that Die
_"Some experiences are literally once in a life-time."_

You don't see armies of Werewolves in After Sundown because Extras who undergo the transformation procedures _die_. And then they stay dead, and are dead. Sometimes they become ghosts, and wander around haunting the lycanthropes that killed them [American Werewolf in London](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/) style.
