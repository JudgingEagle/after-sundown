## Second Person: Advice to Progeny

My Dearest,

If you are reading this, then it appears that you have recently died and been brought back to a semblance of life as one of the living dead. You also presumably drank my blood and witnessed me hand you this very letter and then flee the premises with haste. This doubtless seemed odd to you, and I apologize for the necessity. You will receive further aid and instruction when I am able, but as of the writing of this letter, neither you nor I know when that might be.

The first thing you will do upon reading these words is to try out your powers. Doubtless you will find solace in climbing walls or even flying about. Also, you will be able to quickly heal from any injury, so perhaps you will wish to experiment with the sort of senselessly dangerous activities you previously gave only a slim moment's thought - such as leaping off a building, stabbing yourself in the chest, or thrusting your hand into a fire. These are perfectly reasonable things for you to do, and you should probably get them out of your system sooner rather than later. However, even whilst abandoning yourself to the temporary insanity of genuine magical power you should still maintain a semblance of decorum and a thought towards self preservation and your future.

The first thing for you to keep in mind is that others of your kind take a gratuitously dim view of giving away the show. Supernatural creatures such as yourself maintain their existence in no small part through the expedient of secrecy, and you'll notice that even in your case the reality of magical beings was revealed relatively recently. You _can_ be hurt, and you _can_ die. Yes, even though you are essentially already dead, there are available bigger, more final deaths to be had. The first and foremost danger is _wood_. Avoid that foul stuff like it was bathed in vipers, and if you _must_ experiment with cutting or bashing yourself, make for certain that you do so through the medium of comparatively harmless metal or stone. But also you will want at all times to keep your powers and nature a darkest secret - other creatures may be helpful, but none will long hesitate before turning upon you should your actions jeopardize their safety or obscurity. Your ability to float about the room will doubtlessly seem magical to you - in no small part because it _is_ in fact magical - but mortal and vampire alike will feel threatened if you use it in public. Best not to tempt reprisals.

The second thing to keep in mind is the constant gnawing hunger which will drive you for the rest of time as a farmer drives an ox. Your experience of the cravings will doubtlessly be deeply personal and reminiscent of some craving you felt in life. However, this is no ordinary famine, you crave instead the blood of mortal humans. Actually acquiring this blood to drink is no easy task and will constantly threaten the secrecy of your true nature. Until you can master for yourself a feeding _system_, you will wish to do it as infrequently as possible. Unfortunately, the beast inside you will not stay quiet forever, and you _will_ be driven to feed eventually, and possibly with wild and murderous abandon. Using your powers will make you grow more famished, making it harder to control yourself. Consuming large quantities of blood will likely be fatal for your ~~meals~~ victims (and you _will_ have victims). And if you get hungry enough to lose control, you will very likely drink copious amounts. Try to not get hungry enough to have that happen.

In the meantime, it would probably be expedient to introduce yourself to the local Makhzen government. The Makhzen is an old organization, and by your very existence you are now a member of it. And by old, I do mean _old_. You will, if you avoid the barbs of splinters and thorns, never die. And the leaders of the Makhzen never have. You will doubtlessly find their customs to be archaic and feudal. However, you should remind yourself that age is also a virtue and that these laws have outlasted every institution raised by mortal man. So presumably they have _some_ virtues, even if they are not immediately obvious to you. The address to go to is written on the envelope, you should ask for Florentine - she is an ancient and accomplished mermaid - and she can aid you in presenting yourself to the local Prince better than I can under the circumstances.

And yes, you did read correctly that you will be asking for aid from a mermaid. That is not the limits of the strangeness you will encounter before the night ends and you will long for sleep. The truth is that whilst _most_ stories you have been subjected to are indeed merely stories, there are dozens and dozens of legends that you have heard that - are at least in part - factual. Try to play it cool as much as possible.

Your Sire and Mentor,

_**X**_

## Third Person: Missing Persons

Clich√© as it may be, it _was_ a dark and stormy night. It could not have been elsewise, for the shadowy figures climbing the exterior wall of the office had waited for precisely such an occasion in order to make their ingress. It was their intension to take files that they believed were stored therein, and for this they needed to be protected from being overseen or overheard.

It had been two weeks back that Freddy had gotten the tip that these offices kept strange hours and were probably smuggling something, and after he'd gotten his gang to scope the place out, he was pretty sure that smuggling was the least of the issues. Men and women coming in and out at odd times of the day and night, rolled carpets going in thick in the night and coming out thin in the morning. People walking out who had not been spotted walking in since the surveillance started. There was a mystery going on, and Freddy was pretty sure the answers were inside this building.

Freddy wrestled the window open with more noise than he had hoped for, but behind the constant hiss of wheels on wet asphalt and the incessant patter of rain no one in the city seemed to notice or care. Once the aperture was enough for his muscular frame, he pulled himself in, with his assistant Velma close behind. The room inside was filthy and rank. It smelled like a refrigerator that hadn't been opened in some time, and piles of clothing and discarded packaging littered the floor. As his eyes accustomed themselves to the gloom, he began to make out... squash? The faint yellow light reflected and refracted from street lights through a million tiny prisms of water gave the soft outlines of some kind of growing operation. Pots, vines, and some kind of big fruit lined every shelf. He leaned over to get a closer look...

As Velma squeezed herself through the window, she felt a slight tug on the lodestone she wore tied to a string bracelet. That was odd, and she started to comment on it "Jinkrrrk-!" was all that came out as Freddy suddenly grabbed her by the neck. She could feel his powerful hands clamp down on her throat and began flailing her fists into his arms and torso with what strength she had left. The pounding made a muffled sound like dropping a steak on a counter, but he showed no predilection for loosening his grip to protect himself from the counter assault.

He looked at her purpling face with genuine interest, but what came out of his mouth was the most surprising part of the ghastly situation yet. "Now, huu maiyt _you_ beee?" he inquired as if the words themselves were in an alien tongue. The wounds being inflicted on his body might have been of just passing interest and he genuinely seemed to not recognize Velma at all. And then realization dawned on her as she saw that the lodestone was pointing directly to Freddy.

She hoped the rest of the gang was having better luck, because the prospect of being made a puppet for some alien thing was not part of her plan. But even then she did not give up hope for herself, because there was still a chance she could reach her pocket...

## The Fourth Wall: Starting a Game

A story in After Sundown is like a story you would read in a book or watch in a movie, save that it is written cooperatively by the people playing the game. In order for people to tell a story together, the story has to be something that everyone wants to tell. And that means getting everyone on the same first page as regards basic story themes and content. If one player _really_ doesn't like the inclusion of something (whether it be "graphic descriptions of violence", "sexual situations", or "discussions of economic theory"), that probably has to take precedence over any number of other people at the table wanting to include it.

This sort of compromise is not as difficult as it might at first seem. After all, if someone didn't want to tell multi-author stories involving modern supernatural horror with an emphasis on adventure and mystery would probably have said "No" when you asked them the question "Do you want to play a game of After Sundown?". So before you even begin to hash out the basic disagreements about what kinds of stories you intend to tell, you already understand that you _do_ have broad agreements on genre and story structure. So be prepared to make some concessions to what the other players want to do, whether you're the MC or not. Nevertheless, players will need to know where the game is going to take place and whether the chronicle will be an origin story or an in media res story before they even start to craft themselves characters, so hash that out in the beginning.

## Making a Character

Probably the most important thing you can do while making a character is to discuss with the other players what kinds of characters you'd like to play. There are a lot of characters that would fit into _some_ After Sundown games that won't fit with the specific chronicle you are actually playing. The number one thing you want to look out for is intra-party conflict. And in turn, the number one cause of intra-party conflict is moral disagreements. That is, if you want to be playing a particularly dark game, you might want to make a character who is a serial killer, or a rapist, or whatever. If on the other hand, the other players want to play Syndicate troubleshooters who go on Scooby Doo hunts for supernatural criminals, that kind of character concept isn't going to fly. Heck, if the players want to bewail their loss of humanity and try to fit in with mortal society and listen to [The Cure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure), that kind of character concept probably isn't going to fly. And so on.

Once you've established that your character concept is going to work with the other players, find out about the chronicle and work it in there. If the game is taking place in Paris, it's probably a pretty good idea for your character to speak some French. If the game revolves around police procedurals in gritty New York, make sure your character has _some_ relevant skills and something in their backstory to justify being in that situation. Maybe it should go without saying, but it really doesn't: make sure you know what the actual character generation guidelines being used **are**. It's no good making the whole backstory for a 150 year old Austro-Hungarian Vampire only to get to the table where everyone is making contemporary humans in order to play out the origin story in the 21st century. Even above and beyond the basic category of game (Origin Story, In Media Res, or Power Fantasy), the expected direction of the chronicle may place additional constraints on the PCs. Maybe everyone has to be able to swim, or no one is to be or speak Romanian, or whatever. Talk this all out before you commit too hard to any particular character traits. Ideally, these constraints won't just be the MC jerking you around, but will instead be actual well thought out guidelines to make sure that the chronicle can and will be completed.

### The Curious Tail of Barbara Stanwick

Barbara Stanwick is a sample character, who is played by a sample player who we will call Jenny. Jenny wants to kick ass and take names, but she _also_ wants to identify with her character on a physical basis. To balance these two desires, she chooses to have her alter-ego Barbara be a Werewolf. This allows her to make a character who is a slightly sporty liberal arts type, while still being able to turn into a giant monster and rip a car in half. Fortunately, she is making an In Media Res character and she can totally start with her character already being a Werewolf.

**The Backstory:** Jenny can write whatever backstory she wants, subject to the story _ending_ with Barbara Stanwick being wherever the chronicle is going to take place and being interested in interacting with the chronicle rather than ignoring it or getting on a plane to Boston or something. So ironically the first thing she finds out is where her backstory has to end up. And after discussing it with the MC, she finds that the initial chronicle is going to take place in the San Francisco area, hunting a rogue Werewolf under the auspices of The World Crime League. That sparks some inspiration with Jenny - and her first question to the MC is if it would be disruptive for her to suspect the main villain Werewolf of being the one that mauled Barbara (making her a Werewolf in the first place). The MC lauds as how that sounds like a great idea (as it personalizes the chronicle for Barbara and also motivates her to participate), and so Jenny begins writing.

Barbara is the daughter of the District Attorney of Santa Clara County. She attends the University of California at Berkeley, where she studies literature. Her father wants this to be a pre-law degree, but she has been strongly considering going into teaching. However, things became both simpler and more complicated when she and a couple of acquaintances were attacked and killed by a wild animal after a party in Oakland. She ended up lying in the torn up shreds of a couple of students for several hours, before waking up and making a full recovery. She has since been contacted by Black Hand agents, and has joined that organization as an enforcer from beyond the grave. Also, having been associated with supernatural society for some time, she has presented herself to the local Syndicates and has citizenship in the World Crime League.

Jenny actually writes a backstory that is several pages long, and includes reasons why and how she knows the other player characters (which she worked out _with_ the other players), but that is neither here nor there.

**Attributes:** Because Jenny is making a character for an In Media Res game, she can assign 2 points to her least stat category, 4 points to the middle pair, and 5 points to the top selection. However, she also has 3 points she can assign however she likes, so if she _wanted_, she could bring her "lowest" attribute category to parity with her highest. What she decides to do is to emphasize Barbara's sport and dance background, with a later emphasis on academic development. So she makes Social her highest priority, Physical her next highest, and Mental her lowest. Then she applies her three bonus points to Logic and Charisma. This ends up with attributes of:

| Attribute | | Attribute | | Attribute | |
|:---------|:-:|:----------|:-:|:----------|:-:|
| Strength | 3 | Intuition | 2 | Willpower | 3 |
| Agility | 3 | Logic | 4 | Charisma | 5 | 
| Edge | 3 | Potency | 1 | Power | 13 |

Technically of course, she has not applied the supernaturalness yet, so at this stage she wouldn't have a Potency or Power rating, but it saves time to write it down with the rest of the attributes if you know you're making a Werewolf, which Jenny does. You'll also note that Jenny has cast her net pretty wide - Barbara doesn't have really high physical attributes for a combat oriented character, or really any super high attributes at all. That's deliberate on her part, and actually OK given her magical abilities, which augment the mediocre physicals into deadly ones and still leave her enough Logic and Charisma to investigate well.

**Active Skills:** It's very difficult to make a combat monster without the combat _skill_, but fortunately Jenny has written combat training with The Black Hand into her character's backstory. She'll get 14 points to one category, 19 to another, and 24 to the third. Then she can distribute 6 points wherever. Again, she decides to focus Social, Physical, then Mental. After all, Barbara is still a student. For thematic reasons, she decides to put all six bonus skill points in Combat. She also gets 4 specializations (each Technical skill has one of its own specializations for free).

| Skill | | Skill | | Skill | |
|:---------|:-:|:----------|:-:|:----------|:-:|
| Athletics | 4 | Animal Ken | 2 | Artisan | 4 (Painting) |
| Combat | 6 (Pencak Silat) | Bureaucracy | 6 (Law) | Electronics | 4 (Software) |
| Drive | 1 | Empathy | 4 | Rigging | - |
| Larceny | 4 | Expression | 4 (Dance) | Medicine | - |
| Perception | 6 | Intimiation | 1 | Operations | - |
| Stealth | 4 | Persuasion | 6 (Pedantics) | Research | 6 (Library) |
| Survival | - | Tactics | 1 | Sabotage | - |

All in all, Jenny made a character who could do well as a lawyer or a teacher... or a murderous enforcer. Which is appropriate, because Barbara is still uncertain which direction she'll end up going with her life.

**Backgrounds:** As a character in an In Media Res story, Barbara Stanwick can have 35 points of Backgrounds. She decides to split them up amongst her interests:

* Classical Literature 4
* Modern Fantasy Books 4
* Student Life 3
* Binge Drinking 3
* Fine Cuisine 4
* Secret History of Supernatural Conflict 5
* California Legal System 4
* American Education System 4
* World Crime League Rules and Etiquette 4

The best criminals are also the best lawyers.

**Resources:** Jenny can assign one 3 point Resource, two 2 point Resources, an one 1 point Resource. Also, she has to select an Obligation, but gets a Resource for that too. She assigns them as follows:

* Barbara's backstory includes ending up with a magical mirror that shows whatever is on the other side of a wall it is placed against - like a portable window that isn't transparent on the other side. This requires Jenny to discuss it with the MC, and they agree that this item is a Rating 3 Destiny.
* Barbara Stanwick is still on reasonably good terms with her father, and can get records and information from the Santa Clara County DA's Office. This is a Rating 2 Contact.
* Barbara's parents set her up with a trust fund that is quite substantial. This is a Rating 2 Finances Resource.
* As a student of classical literature, Barbara knows Greek. This is a Rating 1 Languages.
* After being literally pulled out of a pile of bodies where she had been left for dead and then trained in seven deadly Indonesian martial disciplines, Barbara feels obligated to assist The Black Hand in their efforts. This manifests as a Rating 2 Duty.
* Barbara has been allowed into the "Rare Books" archive at UCB - which is a magical library. A Rating 2 Destiny.

**Advantages and Disadvantages:** As a Werewolf, she gets to have Temperamental for free. But Jenny feels that her character's divided loyalties towards her various available lifepaths would be appropriate for the Disadvantage Flake. Having taken an extra Disadvantage, she can select an Advantage as well. She chooses Attractive.

**Magical Transformation:** Barbara Stanwick is a Werewolf in an In Media Res game. She gets all of the inherent Powers of a Werewolf, and also gets to select 2 Basic Powers and an Advanced Power of her choice. She then gets one Basic or Advanced Power that can be either Universal or Lure of Destruction (the Cultic Sorcery of the Black Hand). She chooses to go for the Sorcery option, and her ability list looks like this:

* Tongue of Beasts (Basic Call of the Wild)
* Beast Form (Basic Call of the Wild)
* Revive the Flesh (Basic Fortitude) 
* Vigor (Basic Clout) 
* Quickness (Basic Celerity) 
* Repel (Basic Magnetism) 
* War Form (Celerity / Clout Devotion) 
* The Beckoning (Advanced Call of the Wild)
* Touch of Darkness (Basic Lure of Destruction)
* Glimpse of the Abyss (Advanced Lure of Destruction)
* Attract (Basic Magnetism)
* Summons (Advanced Magnetism)

It is worth noting that she gains +2 to Socialization tests (Advanced Magnetism), +4 to avoid death and healing (Advance Lure of Destruction), +1 Strength (Basic Clout), +2 to Physical Resistance checks (Basic Fortitude), +2 to initiative tests (Basic Celerity), and a +4 to Animal Ken checks that increases to +6 for canines (Advanced Call of the Wild, and she can personally turn into a wolf). However, while many of those are situational, the Clout bonus really is just an always on _thing_. So Jenny chooses to just add it in to her stat line, like this:

| Attribute | | Attribute | | Attribute | |
|:---------|:-:|:----------|:-:|:----------|:-:|
| Strength | 4 | Intuition | 2 | Willpower | 3 |
| Agility | 3 | Logic | 4 | Charisma | 5 |
| Edge | 3 | Potency | 1 | Power | 13 |

**Place in the World:** Jenny has a pretty good idea of what Barbara is about. She lives in a loft in Berkeley and is a citizen in good standing with the World Crime League. She is also an enforcer for The Black Hand. Lycanthropy is driving a wedge between her and the aspirations she has to become a teacher or a lawyer. But she has some good friends amongst the supernaturals, some of whom are the other player characters in her band.
