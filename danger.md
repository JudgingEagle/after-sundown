# Danger
_The world would be a safer place if people didn't do dangerous things._

Action sequences are generally split into 12 second combat rounds. That's five combat rounds in a minute. This means that in the inestimable "side scroller" fight in [Old Boy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/), that the fight goes on for 3 rounds before Dae-su Oh spends a round pretending to be unconscious before he goes at it again. The fight between Spiderman and Green Goblin goes:

* Round 1: Green Goblin throws Peter through a wall
* Round 2: Green Goblin throws a bomb through the hole in the wall
* Round 3: Green Goblin taunts Peter
* Round 4: Green Goblin and Peter exchange punches

Considering how many dice get rolled, such flurries of action can already take a fair amount of time to resolve, so breaking the time down finer than that is generally not worth doing. In fact, when the action gets to even slower parts like cross city chases and boat maneuvers, we pull out of combat time altogether.

Remember that while it is theoretically possible to let loose astounding numbers of bullets in just a second or two, in actual combats it's entirely likely that any particular 12 seconds will go by with no shots at all. Fog of war takes quite a while to roll out. 

## Actions and Reactions

Normally a character may take one Complex Action or two Simple Actions during their turn. A character may do some relatively large number of Free Actions, and like Complex and Simple Actions, all of these are done during the character's turn. Reactions and Movement are done while it is not a character's turn. Interruptions are rare in After Sundown, and normally an action is fully resolved before the next action is declared.

## Initiative Order and Passes
_"Then I attack, then you attack twice, then I attack, then you attack once?"_

At the beginning of a Combat Round, every player rolls a number of dice equal to their Intuition + their Agility. The number of hits is their Initiative Score. Characters act in order of Initiative Scores, and characters whose scores are the same act simultaneously. A character who gets a higher Initiative Score may choose to act _after_ characters with a lower Initiative Score if they want. Each character gets one turn. Characters who are entitled to extra Initiative Passes (either because they have activated Celerity or because they bought them with Edge) get an additional turn after everyone else has moved. The most number of turns you can have in a round is 4.



## Wind and Water
_It was a dark and stormy night..._

It is important to note that weather in the realm of horror is a fair bit worse than the weather of our own world. Just as nearly every horror movie begins with some driving rain and a crash of thunder to set the mood, the night sky of the stories you tell with After Sundown will pelt the earth with lightning and rain all the time. It's atmospheric, and it helps to enforce the feeling of isolation that so many variations of scary stories require.

**Rain:** Water falls from the sky. It's dreary, it's uncomfortable, and it makes it hard to see things that are far away. It also makes things very wet, which is why witches wear wide brimmed hats. But the important things from the standpoint of _game mechanics_ is the fact that it makes things wet and makes it hard to see.
[table][mrow]Types of Rain[mcol]Impeded Visibility[mcol]You get wet unless...
| Fine Mist | Remote | ...you move around a bit.
| Adequate Drizzle | Extreme | ...you have a hat.
| Continuous Shower | Way Out | ...you have an umbrella
| Tumultuous Rain | Short | ...you are wearing rain gear.
Note: the Sun is effectively blocked by the clouds
| Uncompromising Deluge | Near | ...you have a diving suit.[/table]

**Fog:** when there's fog in the air it reduces contrast and obscures. It scatters light sources and can paradoxically cause people to be blinded by glare if they shine lights trying to see better. But mostly it saves us money on sets, because far away things become indistinct and altogether invisible. As fog becomes thicker, the distance one can see things clearly is reduced, and the distance one can see anything at all is reduced as well. Bright lights get scattered in fog and ca produce glare. It is entirely possible for a fog to have reduced visibility _and_ overstimulation at the same time. Dust and smoke clouds reduce visibility based on their thickness just as fog does, but they are usually composed of light absorbent particles and do not create glare when light is shed within them.
[table]| **Fog Thickness** | **Impeded Visibility** | **Limit of Vision**
| Thin | 200 meters | Remote (1200 meters)
| Light | 100 meters | Extreme (600 meters)
| Medium | 20 meters | Extreme (300 meters)
| Thick | 10 meters | Way Out (100 meters)
Note: the Sun is effectively blocked by the Fog.
| Pea Soup | 1 meter | 2 meters[/table]

**Wind:** Air blows around. It carries one's words away before they have had a chance to impart their intended convictions, ruining apologies and love confessions both. As in the real world, the relative strength of wind in After Sundown is represented on the Beaufort Windforce Scale. However, the bottom end of that scale doesn't make any difference (whether the "leaves are in motion" in a gentle breeze or "not" in an actual dead calm, characters can leave books on park benches without fear that they will fly open). As such, the minimum value of wind strength in the game is 3 - even when the story is taking place inside and such. That's a little awkward, but it beats the alternative of not being able to use genuine meteorological data in the game.
[table]| **Wind Strength** | **It's Called...** | **You see...** | **Game Effects**
| **3** | Gentle Breeze | ...leaves sway. | None.
| **4** | Moderate Breeze | ...dust and loose paper kicked up. | Dusty areas gain thin fog. 
| **5** | Fresh Breeze | ...whole branches sway. |

| **7** | High Wind | ...upper floors in tall buildings shift. | Walking against the wind is like moving in difficult ground.
| **8** | Gale | ...campfires blown out. | Driving Conditions difficult. Movement on foot difficult. Thrown objects penalized.
| **9** | Strong Gale | ...a tree blow down. | Staying upright out of cover is a Hard stunt. (Strength + Athletics or Survival, Threshold 3)
| **10** | Storm | ...roof tiles peel up and clatter. | 
| **11** | Violent Storm | ...roof tiles fly off of buildings. | Characters can't make themselves heard if they try.
| **12** | Hurricane | ...some windows breaking. |

## Armor
_Some people wear their armor on the inside, as some sort of metaphorical refusal to emotionally connect with others. I find that kevlar vests are much more effective at stopping bullets._

Characters will sometimes wear armor. Armor makes it less likely that a character will die when placed into a deadly situation. Armor is heavier than normal clothes, and wearing it is tiring. However, there are characters in After Sundown who have Patience of the Mountain and literally do not get tired. And they often wear armor all the time, even to sleep. It should be noted however that most of the world has a level of civilization that makes wearing armor problematic socially.

Armor has a different rating against different kinds of attacks. The Ballistics rating applies against guns and explosives and the like. The Melee rating applies against knives and claws in addition to baseball bats and large thrown objects like rocks and cars. And finally, the Heat value applies against getting set on fire and also cold. The rating of armor adds additional soak dice. In addition, a character with an armor rating can buy a number of hits on soak tests equal to their armor rating at the rate of 1 hit per three dice. So a character with 2 Armor against an attack could set aside 3 soak dice for one automatic hit or 6 soak dice for 2 automatic hits.

Most armor does not cover the character's whole body, and an attacker who knows about the armor can attack the unarmored bits by voluntarily increasing their to-hit threshold by 1. For armor that truly covers the whole body, such as riot gear or hazmat suits, that is not an option. Remember that outr√© armor like that is often rather hard to explain socially, so even characters who _could_ wear such comfortably usually don't.

| Kevlar Shirt | 2 | 1 | 0
| Flak Vest | 4 | 3 | 1
| Chain Mail | 2 | 6 | 2
| Riot Gear | 6 | 6 | 2
| Hazmat Suit | 1 | 2 | 4
| Fire PPEs | 2 | 3 | 6

## Healing and Death
_Good as new<br />
...or not..._

When characters are injured, there are two possibilities: they can either get better or not. Medically speaking, injured tissue can resolve into healed or regenerated tissue, it can resolve into a scar, or it can die. This is actually much farther in-depth than we care to go into. When a character is given time to heal, they reduce the number of boxes that are filled in with a type of damage by 2. However, if there is at least one box remaining with that kind of damage it is _worsened_ to the next type (this doesn't happen for Aggravated Wounds, which are already the worst type). So for example, if a character has 3 boxes with Normal Wounds, after 20 minutes of healing, it would be one box with a Normal and Lethal slash in it. If a character is running around being the Action Man, they don't heal at all. Healing doesn't really happen until the character takes some time off from ninja flips and car chases. The exception is characters who have suffered incapacitating or terminal injuries, who start the cycle of healing and possible death right away.
[table]| **Wounds** | **Symbol** | **Healing Time**
| Normal | **[/]** | 20 minutes
| Lethal | **[\]** | 1 day
| Aggravated | **[[s] [/s]]** | 3 Days[/table]

### Incapacitating and Terminal Wounds

If a character's entire track is filled, the character's healing timeframe is increased by one category until they have at least one box that has no wounds in it. This means that a character whose track fills up with Normal Wounds, that they will be unconscious for an hour unless someone delivers first aid in the meantime. 

If a character has a Terminal Wound, they are dead in 5 minutes unless they spend an Edge or they get 3 hits on a Healing Test, or someone successfully applies first aid. At 1 or 2 hits on a healing or first aid test, the timeframe of death from a Terminal Wound is increased (to 20 minutes, or 1 hour respectively), which may allow a character to get to a place where a better shot at a final Healing Test can be made (or medical personnel to get to them, giving their skill to the final Healing Test). Even though a character with a Terminal Wound is going to be dead before a sufficient timeframe would pass to provide a healing test, a character is always allowed one Healing Test just before they die.

A character who is incapacitated or terminally wounded can also have their death hastened with further injury. When the character's wound boxes are filled with Lethal damage, additional injuries accumulate towards a threshold of outright killing the target. An injury that would itself be incapacitating or terminal accumulates two towards this death threshold, and an injury that would be Serious or less accumulates only one. A character's Death Threshold is generally equal to their Willpower (characters with Lure of Destruction have a higher Death Threshold). And yes, this means that once someone is already on death's door, it takes quite a few extra bullets to push them through it - it's not like they are going to go _into_ shock at that point.

### The Healing Test

When a character is healing, they are entitled to a healing test to prevent lethal or aggravated damage from accumulating. The healing test is Edge + Survival, and is modified by the conditions the character is in while they are healing. If the character gets a hit, the round of healing goes by without generating any extra wounds. If another character is on hand to provide medical care, that character's Logic + Medicine test works together with the injured character's Edge + Survival test as a Teamwork test. Which counts as the main and which counts as the assistant depends on who has the bigger dice pool.

**Healing Conditions Table:**
[table]| **Conditions are...** | **Healing Modifier**
| Dangerous | -2
| Distressing | +0
| Restful | +1
| Sanitary | +2
| Awesome | +4[/table]

The healing test is especially important for characters who suffer Incapacitating Lethal or Aggravated injuries, because the first time normal wounds heal and generate a Lethal slash when the track is already full will push them into a terminal wound. Note that this really means that if an Extra takes an Incapacitating Wound from a knife or a bullet that they will always go Terminal in an hour unless medical personnel come and save them (they will also be able to crawl around at that point, perhaps able to give some dramatic piece of information before they die).

### First Aid

When a character is trained in first aid, they can reduce the amount of damage on someone substantially. This is pretty much a one-time deal and has to be performed within the "golden hour" of the injury (and hour from when the patient was injured, not an hour from first medical contact). First aid is a Logic + Medicine test. Removing 2 Normal slashes is threshold 1, also removing 2 Lethal slashes is threshold 2, and further removing 2 Aggravated lines is threshold 3. Additional hits remove an additional 1 slash of each type. So a five hit First Aid test would remove 4 Normal, Lethal, and Aggravated lines from the victim's wound box.

If the victim has a Terminal Wound, it is instead Threshold 3 to stabilize them and reduce them to a normal Incapacitated state. Additional hits remove wounds from boxes as normal. But perhaps the biggest advantage of First Aid is the _time_ it takes to make the first healing test during medical treatment - which is one time frame shorter than normal for the left-most injury type in the wound track (1 minute to rouse someone from Normal Damage, 5 minutes to treat Lethal Damage, etc.).

### Being Dead
_"Okay, **now** we go through the pockets looking for loose change."_

Characters in horror die from time to time. Sometimes a character will end up dying several times, because After Sundown posits ghastly life after death and even has magical ways to restore life to the living. When a character dies, all of their powers that cost Power Points to activate or which otherwise last for a scene end. In addition, anything they have going that could be dispelled is dispelled with their death. A character's Power pool is also emptied at the moment the character actually dies. Very importantly, a character's power schedule (if any) does not change just because they are dead. A Strigoi can still be fed blood to regain Power Points and a Frankenstein can still be recharged while a corpse. This usually only matters if they have the Restoration Power, but there are other ways to raise the dead, and it might be important that they rise up with a power reserve on hand.

The dead may also come back as Ghosts, whether they are Luminaries or Extras. In After Sundown, no one becomes a Ghost until they've been dead for three settings of the sun. There are movies in which the spirit is left standing there as the body hits the floor, and there are movies in which the spirit wakes up having been dead and buried for a couple days. After Sundown's assumed setting is the latter.

Sometimes a player may want to continue their character as a Wraith rather than start a new character or have their character restored to life. This is a workable storyline, but it is fraught with peril because Wraiths are not normally considered playable (being constantly insubstantial while outside the Gloom). If the players agree, the character can be converted into a Wraith, with their Powers traded out for the basic Wraith abilities, starting what is in essence a new Origin Story. Being a Wraith should not be a license to print superpowers, so the new Powers that Wraiths get should replace some of the abilities they already had rather than piling on.
